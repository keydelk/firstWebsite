# firstWebsite

This is my first website, I'm doing this project to practice HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP,
and SQL, as well as learning to use git and github.

I may add a family point tracking app and/or some simple Javascript games at some point.

## Installation

I'm hosting this on an old desktop running Debian Linux with the LAMP stack (Linux, 
Apache2, MySQL, and PHP). If you are running a similar setup, just clone the repository
into the base directory for the site (usually /var/www)

## Usage

Not really a useful site at the moment, but feel free to use it as a template

## Contributing

I'm not really looking for contributors at the moment, this is just a practice project.
